## Project Structure

The main components of the chat application include:

- `chat/consumers.py`: WebSocket consumer for handling real-time communication
- `chat/models.py`: Database models for Conversation and Message
- `chat/views.py`: Django views for rendering pages and handling requests
- `chat/urls.py`: URL routing for the chat application
- `config/routing.py`: WebSocket routing configuration
- `chat/configure_llm.py`: Configuration for language model integration
- `chat/templates/chat/chat.html`: Main template for the chat interface
- `chat/api.py`: ViewSets for RESTful API
- `chat/serializers.py`: Serializers for API data representation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Django-Chat.git
   cd Django-Chat
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add necessary variables (e.g., `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`)

5. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Configuration

The project uses a `base.py` file for Django settings. Key configurations include:

- `INSTALLED_APPS`: Includes 'daphne', 'channels', 'rest_framework', 'corsheaders', and 'drf_spectacular' among others.
- `ASGI_APPLICATION`: Set to 'config.asgi.application' for WebSocket support.
- `CHANNEL_LAYERS`: Configured to use Redis as the backend.
- `REST_FRAMEWORK`: Configured with default permission classes and authentication classes.
- `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS`: Configuration for API documentation using drf-spectacular.
- `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN`: Token for accessing Hugging Face models.

## Usage

1. Register a new account or log in to an existing one.
2. Start a new conversation or select an existing one from the dashboard.
3. Type your message in the input field and press enter to send.
4. The AI assistant will respond in real-time.
5. You can view your conversation history and manage your chats from the dashboard.

## API Endpoints

The project includes a RESTful API for conversations and messages. Key endpoints include:

- `/api/conversations/`: List and create conversations
- `/api/conversations/<uuid:pk>/`: Retrieve, update, or delete a specific conversation
- `/api/messages/`: List and create messages
- `/api/messages/<int:pk>/`: Retrieve, update, or delete a specific message

API documentation is available at:
- `/api/schema/swagger-ui/`: Swagger UI for API documentation
- `/api/schema/redoc/`: ReDoc for API documentation

## WebSocket Integration

The application uses WebSockets for real-time communication. The WebSocket consumer is defined in `chat/consumers.py` and handles the following operations:

- Establishing WebSocket connections
- Receiving and processing messages
- Generating AI responses using language models
- Sending responses back to the client

WebSocket routing is configured in `config/routing.py`.
